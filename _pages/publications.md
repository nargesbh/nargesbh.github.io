# Research Experience

## University of Hamburg, Germany

### Research Assistant
*Under Prof. Chriss Beimann and Florian Schneider*

#### State-of-the-Art Multi-Modal LLMs for Text-Video Retrieval
- **Duration**: May 2023 - Present

In this ongoing project, our mission is to implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using Video-LLAMA as the Language Model (LM) for zero-shot retrieval and/or Visual Question Answering (VQA). Our aim is zero-shot retrieval and/or Visual Question Answering (VQA). We plan to leverage advanced models like XCLIP and Video-LLAMA encoders to enhance our research. This project is at the forefront of exploring the fusion of textual and visual data for efficient information retrieval.

[#### Video Retrieval Application](https://github.com/nargesbh/Video-text-retrieval-tool/blob/main/Video-Retrieval-report.pdf)
- **Duration**: Feb 2023 - Apr 2023

In this project, our goal was to develop a Video-Text Retrieval application using the MSR-VTT dataset. We focused on enabling users to retrieve relevant video scenes based on text queries.
A notable feature of our approach was the use of the Xclip model's encoders to generate embeddings for both text and videos. We explored different Xclip encoder variants, including "microsoft/xclip-base-patch32," "microsoft/xclip-base-patch16," and "microsoft/xclip-large-patch14."
This project provided practical experience in video-text retrieval and the application of state-of-the-art models for multimodal information retrieval.


## KU Leuven, Belgium

### Visiting Scholar
*Under Prof. Hugo Van Hamme*

#### Project Title: Relating Output Symbol Probabilities With Confidence in an End-to-End Speech Recognizer
- **Duration**: July 2022 - Sep 2022

During my time at KU Leuven, we embarked on a fascinating project within the domain of speech recognition. Our primary focus was to evaluate the accuracy of a speech recognition network's predicted probabilities. We made a noteworthy discovery: the network exhibited an unexpected level of uncertainty in its predictions, despite achieving high accuracy with low probabilities. Our research aimed to address this intriguing challenge by introducing prediction patterns to a designed model. Through this approach, we sought to enhance the network's probability evaluation per character, ultimately improving the overall performance of the speech recognition system. This project delved deep into both the theoretical and practical aspects of speech recognition technology, contributing to advancements in this vital field.
