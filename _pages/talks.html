# [Grapevine Leaves Classification](https://github.com/nargesbh/Grapevine-Leaves-Classification/tree/main)

![Project Image](leaves2-small.jpg)

**Project Date**: July 2022\
*Data mining final project*
## Description
 The primary objective is to classify grapevine leaves into five distinct classes. Here I implemented multiple deep machine learning models using a transfer learning approach based on pre-trained convolutional neural networks including MobileNetV2, ResNet50, EfficientNetB3, and InceptionNetV3. The project also explores the impact of autoencoders on classification accuracy and employs 10-fold cross-validation as a performance metric.
## Libraries Used
tensorflow, keras, PIL, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn

![Project Image](https://github.com/nargesbh/nargesbh.github.io/blob/master/_pages/pr2.png)

**Project Date**: May 2023\
*Image Processing project*
## Description
In this project, I explored various deep learning models for image classification, specifically in the context of histopathology image analysis.

          In this project I embark on a journey to enhance Persian language understanding through state-of-the-art machine learning.
          My core objective revolves around accurately labeling each word in Persian text with its corresponding part of speech, 
          a fundamental task in natural language processing. By leveraging a meticulously curated dataset of Persian texts, 
          I employ a range of machine learning models, including Gaussian Naive Bayes, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Perceptron,
           and Logistic Regression, to decode the grammatical structure of Persian sentences. My project's success hinges on comprehensive feature engineering,
            innovative feature selection techniques, and meticulous model evaluation, ensuring that our POS tagging model meets the highest standards of accuracy 
            and precision.</p>

            <h1>Parkinson's Disease Classification</h1>
            <p><strong>Project Date</strong>: June 2022</p>

              Parkinson's disease is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder that profoundly affects a
               person's ability to move and leads to symptoms like tremors, slowness of movement, and muscle 
               rigidity. Timely diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment and management, and this project 
               seeks to contribute to that goal by employing cutting-edge data analysis techniques. I embark on an exciting
                exploration of various machine learning algorithms, each with its unique strengths and 
                characteristics. These include Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines,
                 and Random Forests. Through rigorous experimentation and cross-validation, I fine-tune these
                  algorithms to achieve optimal performance, ensuring they are finely attuned to the nuances of 
                  Parkinson's disease classification. Recognizing the complexity of my dataset, I implement Principal 
                  Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce its dimensionality while preserving vital information. 
                  The outcomes of this endeavor hold the promise of significantly improving the lives of 
                  individuals affected by Parkinson's disease by enabling swifter and more accurate 
                  diagnosis and management.
