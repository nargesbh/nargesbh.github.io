        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This is a final project for the data mining course. Using pre-trained models and transfer learning, the aim is to classify the five classes of grapevine leaves. The pretrained models are MobileNetV2, ResNet50, EfficientNetB3, and InceptionNetV3. We see the effects of autoencoders on the accuracy and use 10 fold cross validation as a measurement. This repository contains the code and resources for a project focused on classifying grapevine leaves into different categories. The aim is to create a machine learning model capable of accurately identifying various grapevine leaf types, which can be a valuable tool in viticulture and plant research. I used several models as: VGG19, ResNet50, Inception-V3, Inception-V3, and at the end, I used an autoencoder. Implemented an autoencoder to evaluate its impact on accuracy and used 10-fold cross-validation for evaluation.
