# [Grapevine Leaves Classification](https://github.com/nargesbh/Grapevine-Leaves-Classification/tree/main)

![Project Image](leaves2-small.jpg)

**Project Date**: July 2022\
*Data mining final project*
## Description
 The primary objective is to classify grapevine leaves into five distinct classes. Here I implemented multiple deep machine learning models using a transfer learning approach based on pre-trained convolutional neural networks including MobileNetV2, ResNet50, EfficientNetB3, and InceptionNetV3. The project also explores the impact of autoencoders on classification accuracy and employs 10-fold cross-validation as a performance metric.
## Libraries Used
tensorflow, keras, PIL, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn

![Project Image](https://github.com/nargesbh/nargesbh.github.io/blob/master/_pages/pr2.png)

**Project Date**: May 2023\
*Image Processing project*
## Description
In this project, I explored various deep learning models for image classification, specifically in the context of histopathology image analysis. I trained and evaluated these models on a custom dataset and compared the performance of different model architectures. The models include the homework model, an updated model with modified convolutional layers, A pre-trained ResNet-50 model fine-tuned for our classification task.

## Libraries Used
tensorflow, keras, OpenCV, PIL, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib

             <h2>Description</h2>
             <p>This project is the final assignment for a data mining course. The primary objective is to classify grapevine leaves into five distinct classes using various deep learning models, including MobileNetV2, ResNet50, EfficientNetB3, and InceptionNetV3. The project also explores the impact of autoencoders on classification accuracy and employs 10-fold cross-validation as a performance metric.</p>
             <p>The repository contains the project's source code and resources, with a specific focus on the classification of grapevine leaves. The overarching goal is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately identifying different grapevine leaf types. This model has potential applications in viticulture and plant research.</p>
