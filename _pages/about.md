 I'm a 22-year-old senior pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the University of Tehran, Iran. Currently, I'm on the lookout for fully funded opportunities in multimodal signal processing, computer vision, or natural language processing for my Master's or direct PhD.

 What sets me apart is my hands-on experience in these fields. During my internship at KULeuven under the supervision of [Prof. Hugo Van Hamme](https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/00040707), I contributed to an End-to-End Speech Recognizer project, an endeavor that revealed the intricate world of natural language processing.

Additionally, my time at Hamburg University under the supervision of [Prof. Chriss Beimann](https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/lt/people/chris-biemann.html) exposed me to the captivating realm of text-video retrieval. There, I had the privilege of working with advanced models like Xclip, and I'm currently collaborating with them on cutting-edge Multi-Modal Language Models for Text-Video Retrieval. These experiences have not only affirmed my passion but have also fueled my determination to pursue these domains vigorously in the future.
