I'm a 22-year-old senior pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the University of Tehran, Iran. At this age, I find myself on the cusp of exciting possibilities, driven by a relentless curiosity for the world of Computer Science. 

## Academic Aspirations

I am currently a senior student pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the University of Tehran, Iran. However, my journey doesn't stop here; it's merely the beginning. I am looking for fully funded opportunities for my Master's or a direct PhD, focusing on the captivating fields of multimodal signal processing, computer vision, and natural language processing.

## Hands-On Expertise

What sets me apart is my hands-on experience in these domains. During my internship at KULeuven, I had the privilege of working under the mentorship of [Prof. Hugo Van Hamme](https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/00040707). We embarked on an ambitious project - Relating Output Symbol Probabilitiesan in an End-to-End Speech Recognizer. This journey delved deep into the intricate world of natural language processing, igniting a passion within me that continues to burn brightly.

My academic journey also took me to Hamburg University, under the guidance of [Prof. Chriss Beimann](https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/lt/people/chris-biemann.html). This experience opened doors to the captivating realm of text-video retrieval. Working closely with advanced models like Xclip, I am currently engaged in research on Multi-Modal Language Models for Text-Video Retrieval.

These experiences have not only affirmed my passion but have also fueled my determination to pursue these domains vigorously in the future.

Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to sharing my exciting adventures with you.
