# [Grapevine-Leaves-Classification](https://github.com/nargesbh/Grapevine-Leaves-Classification/tree/main)

**Project Date**: July 2022

## Description
This project is the final assignment for my data mining course. The primary objective is to classify grapevine leaves into five distinct classes. Here I implemented multiple deep machine learning models using a transfer learning approach based on pre-trained convolutional neural networks including MobileNetV2, ResNet50, EfficientNetB3, and InceptionNetV3. The project also explores the impact of autoencoders on classification accuracy and employs 10-fold cross-validation as a performance metric.

## Libraries Used
tensorflow, keras, PIL, pandas, numpy, sklearn
